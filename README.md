    - [Python](https://github.com/darwin-a/PersonalProjects/tree/master/Personal%20Programming%20Projects/Python)
      - Data mining for lectures
      - Twitter bot
      - Discord bot
2. [365DataScience course](https://github.com/darwin-a/PersonalProjects/tree/master/Physics%20Education%20Research)
      - Pandas pivot dashboard
      - SQL

Each category has their own variety of projects and should be accompanied by some form of documentation.
