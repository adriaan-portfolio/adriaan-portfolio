# Adriaan van Niekerk - Projects Portfolio

## Index

This repository holds all of my personal projects that I've done over the years. Currently they're binned in three different categories

1. Personal programming projects
    - Python
      - [Data extraction for lectures](https://github.com/adriaan-portfolio/tbl-data-extractor)
      - [Twitter bot](https://github.com/adriaan-portfolio/xmas-loading)

Each project has its own README that discusses the project in more detail. 

## Background
