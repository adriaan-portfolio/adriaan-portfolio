    - Python
      - [Data extraction for lectures](https://github.com/adriaan-portfolio/tbl-data-extractor)
      - [Twitter bot](https://github.com/adriaan-portfolio/xmas-loading)

2. Formal courses
    - [PyTorch Zero to GANs](https://github.com/adriaan-portfolio/pytorch-zero-to-gans)
    - [365DataScience](https://github.com/adriaan-portfolio/365datascience)
    - Kaggle's 30 days of ML (starts 2 August 2021)

Each project has its own README that discusses the project in more detail.
